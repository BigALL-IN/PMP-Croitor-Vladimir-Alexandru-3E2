b) 

Higher Y makes posterior shift to higher n values. More buyers means more visitors must have been present. The posterior must satisfy n >= Y, so observing Y = 10 shifts the distribution upward compared to Y = 0.

Lower Theta makes posterior shifts to higher n values. A lower buying chance requires more visitors to produce the same number of buyers.


d) 

The posterior P(n | Y, theta) is our updated belief about the parameter n after observing Y buyers. It answers "How many visitors were there?" and only accounts for uncertainty about n.

The predictive posterior P(Y* | Y, θ) is our prediction for future buyers Y* tomorrow. It answers "How many buyers should we expect tomorrow?" and accounts for both uncertainty about n and the randomness of the buying process itself
